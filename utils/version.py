"""
Version management for ACM.

This module defines the current version of ACM and provides utilities for version tracking
across logs, outputs, and database entries. Version follows semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).

Versioning Strategy:
- MAJOR: Significant architecture changes or breaking changes (e.g., v10→v11)
- MINOR: New features, detector improvements, algorithm enhancements (e.g., v11.0→v11.1)
- PATCH: Bug fixes, refinements, performance improvements (e.g., v11.0.0→v11.0.1)

Release Management:
- All releases tagged with git annotated tags (e.g., v11.0.0)
- Each tag includes comprehensive release notes
- Feature branches use descriptive names: feature/*, fix/*, refactor/*, docs/*
- Merges to main use --no-ff to preserve history
- Production deployments use specific tags (never merge commits)

# v11.2.3: ADDITIONAL P0 ANALYTICAL FIXES - Regime and degradation improvements
# - P0 FIX #2: HDBSCAN transient-aware clustering (ANALYTICAL AUDIT FLAW #2)
#   - Detects high rate-of-change signals indicating transient-rich data
#   - Automatically reduces min_cluster_size from 2% to 0.5% (20-50 samples)
#   - Prevents misclassification of startup/shutdown transients as noise
#   - Critical for equipment with <1% transient operating time
# - P0 FIX #3: Regime-conditioned degradation modeling (ANALYTICAL AUDIT FLAW #3)
#   - New RegimeConditionedDegradationModel class in degradation_model.py
#   - Fits separate LinearTrendModel per operating regime
#   - Accounts for regime-specific degradation rates (high-load vs low-load)
#   - Simulates regime transitions using Markov chain for accurate RUL forecasting
#   - Prevents averaged-out trends that cause 55% RUL prediction errors
# Building on v11.2.2 circular tuning, confidence harmonic mean, and promotion criteria
# v11.2.2: P0 ANALYTICAL FIXES - Critical reliability improvements from comprehensive audit
# - P0 FIX #1: Circular weight tuning guard now DEFAULTS to True (was False)
#   - Prevents self-reinforcing feedback loops in detector fusion
#   - Added weight stability guard: rejects tuning if drift > 20% (configurable)
#   - Protects against mode collapse where weights converge to extreme values
# - P0 FIX #4: Confidence calculation changed from geometric to harmonic mean
#   - Properly penalizes imbalanced confidence factors
#   - Example: regime=0.1 now yields overall=0.31 (was 0.56, too optimistic)
#   - Harmonic mean prevents high factors from masking critically low factors
# - P0 FIX #10: Tightened model promotion criteria for production reliability
#   - min_silhouette_score: 0.15 → 0.40 (require decent cluster separation)
#   - min_stability_ratio: 0.6 → 0.75 (reduce regime thrashing from 40% to 25%)
#   - min_training_rows: 200 → 400 (better statistical significance)
#   - min_consecutive_runs: 3 → 5 (more validation before promotion)
#   - max_forecast_mape: 50.0 → 35.0 (tighter forecasting accuracy)
#   - max_forecast_rmse: 15.0 → 12.0 (tighter error bounds)
# - ANALYTICAL AUDIT: Comprehensive review documented in docs/ACM_V11_ANALYTICAL_AUDIT.md
#   - Identified 12 flaws across detector fusion, regime clustering, RUL estimation
#   - 4 P0 (critical), 5 P1 (high), 3 P2 (medium) issues documented
#   - This release addresses the 4 P0 issues for immediate reliability gains
# Building on v11.2.1 confidence & lifecycle fixes

# v11.1.6: REGIME ANALYTICAL CORRECTNESS - Critical clustering fixes from expert audit
# - REGIME_MODEL_VERSION bumped to "3.0" (breaking change in model serialization)
# - FIX #1 (P0): Created tag taxonomy (OPERATING_TAG_KEYWORDS, CONDITION_TAG_KEYWORDS)
#   - Operating variables: speed, rpm, load, flow, pressure, power, stroke, valve, frequency
#   - Condition indicators: bearing, winding, vibration, current, voltage, temp, lube, oil
#   - Regime basis now EXCLUDES condition indicators (they measure health, not operating mode)
# - FIX #2 (P0): Uniform scaling of entire basis
#   - StandardScaler now applied to ENTIRE concatenated basis (PCA + raw)
#   - Previously only raw columns were scaled; PCA columns had different variance scale
# - FIX #3 (P0): Calibrated UNKNOWN threshold
#   - Replaced arbitrary 1/k heuristic with training-derived P95 distance threshold
#   - Added _compute_training_distances() function
#   - UNKNOWN assignments now statistically meaningful (P95 acceptance region)
# - FIX #4 (P0): Label mapping for stable regime labels
#   - Added label_map_ to RegimeModel for explicit old→new label mapping
#   - New apply_label_map() method on RegimeModel
#   - align_regime_labels() now creates and stores proper mapping
# - FIX #5 (P1): Transient detection on operating inputs only
#   - detect_transient_states() now filters to operating variables only
#   - Condition indicators (bearing temps, vibration) excluded from ROC calculation
# - FIX #6 (P1): Time-based smoothing
#   - smooth_labels() now accepts timestamps and window_seconds parameters
#   - Derives window size from median sampling interval for consistent time spans
# - FIX #7 (P2): Feature basis signature
#   - Added _compute_basis_signature() for MD5 hash of basis configuration
#   - Stored in model metadata for cache invalidation on basis changes
# Building on v11.1.5 database integrity fixes

# v11.1.5: DATABASE INTEGRITY FIXES - ID columns and relationship tracking

# v11.1.4: ANALYTICAL CORRECTNESS FIXES - Critical ML/stats bug resolution
# - fuse.py: GENERALIZED correlation adjustment for ALL detector pairs (not just PCA)
#   - All pairs with correlation > 0.5 are now discounted proportionally
#   - Prevents double-counting of correlated detector information
# - degradation_model.py: Added _detect_and_handle_health_jumps() method
#   - Detects maintenance resets (health jumps > 15%)
#   - Uses only post-jump data for trend fitting
#   - Logs maintenance events with magnitude for audit trail
# - acm_main.py: Fixed seasonal adjustment data flow (CRITICAL BUG)
#   - train_numeric/score_numeric were adjusted but train/score (used downstream) were not
#   - Now properly updates train/score with adjusted sensor values
# - SKILL.md: Added comprehensive Analytical Correctness Rules section
#   - 7 mandatory rules with code examples
#   - Statistical constants reference (MAD to σ = 1.4826)
#   - Code review checklist for analytical code

# v10.2.0 Release Notes
RELEASE_NOTES_V10_2 = """
ACM v10.2.0 - MHAL Deprecation & Detector Simplification (2025-12-16)

SUMMARY:
  Removed Mahalanobis detector from active pipeline - it was mathematically redundant 
  with PCA-T² (both compute Mahalanobis distance, but PCA-T² is numerically stable).

BREAKING CHANGES:
  ⚠ mhal_z no longer computed (fusion weight set to 0.0)
  ⚠ mhal_params no longer saved to model registry
  ⚠ Legacy mhal_z columns in SQL tables will stop receiving new data

DETECTOR ARCHITECTURE (6 Active Detectors):
  Each detector answers a specific "what's wrong?" question:
  
  | Detector | Z-Score   | Fault Type                              |
  |----------|-----------|----------------------------------------|
  | AR1      | ar1_z     | Sensor drift, control loop issues      |
  | PCA-SPE  | pca_spe_z | Correlation/coupling breakdown         |
  | PCA-T²   | pca_t2_z  | Operating point far from center        |
  | IForest  | iforest_z | Rare/novel operating conditions        |
  | GMM      | gmm_z     | Distribution shift, mode confusion     |
  | OMR      | omr_z     | Sensor relationship violations         |

MATHEMATICAL JUSTIFICATION:
  - Mahalanobis D² = (x-μ)ᵀΣ⁻¹(x-μ) in raw feature space
  - PCA-T² = Σᵢ zᵢ²/λᵢ in PCA space (orthogonal components)
  - These are mathematically equivalent (same distance metric)
  - PCA-T² is numerically stable: covariance is diagonal in PCA space
  - MHAL suffered from ill-conditioned covariance with multicollinearity

DEFAULT FUSION WEIGHTS (v10.2.0):
  pca_spe_z: 0.30  (correlation breaks)
  pca_t2_z:  0.20  (multivariate outliers - replaces MHAL)
  ar1_z:     0.20  (temporal patterns)
  iforest_z: 0.15  (rare states)
  omr_z:     0.10  (sensor relationships)
  gmm_z:     0.05  (distribution anomalies)
  mhal_z:    0.00  (DEPRECATED)

CODE CHANGES:
  - core/acm_main.py: Removed all mhal_detector references
  - core/correlation.py: MahalanobisDetector marked DEPRECATED in docstring
  - utils/detector_labels.py: Updated mhal_z description to show deprecated
  - core/model_persistence.py: Removed mhal_params from persistence
  - scripts/test_model_registry.py: Removed mhal_params from test data

MIGRATION:
  No database migration required. Existing mhal_z columns will simply
  receive NULL or 0 values going forward.
