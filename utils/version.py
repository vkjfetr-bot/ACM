Version management for ACM.

This module defines the current version of ACM and provides utilities for version tracking
across logs, outputs, and database entries. Version follows semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).

Versioning Strategy:
- MAJOR: Significant architecture changes or breaking changes (e.g., v10→v11)
- MINOR: New features, detector improvements, algorithm enhancements (e.g., v11.0→v11.1)
- PATCH: Bug fixes, refinements, performance improvements (e.g., v11.0.0→v11.0.1)

Release Management:
- All releases tagged with git annotated tags (e.g., v11.0.0)
- Each tag includes comprehensive release notes
- Feature branches use descriptive names: feature/*, fix/*, refactor/*, docs/*
- Merges to main use --no-ff to preserve history
- Production deployments use specific tags (never merge commits)

  ✓ Two forecasting methods:
    - LinearTrend: Simple extrapolation with residual confidence intervals
    - VAR (Vector AutoRegression): Multivariate forecasting for correlated sensors
  ✓ Per-sensor bounds enforcement (configurable min/max values)
  ✓ Regime-aware forecasting (forecasts tagged with operating regime)
  ✓ 7-day forecast horizon (168 hours) with hourly granularity

  7. Monitor first 24hrs for errors and auto-tuning
  8. Verify Grafana dashboards showing RUL/forecasts
  9. If critical issues: run 60_rollback_to_v9.sql + checkout v9.0.0

# v10.2.0 Release Notes
RELEASE_NOTES_V10_2 = """
ACM v10.2.0 - MHAL Deprecation & Detector Simplification (2025-12-16)

SUMMARY:
  Removed Mahalanobis detector from active pipeline - it was mathematically redundant 
  with PCA-T² (both compute Mahalanobis distance, but PCA-T² is numerically stable).

BREAKING CHANGES:
  ⚠ mhal_z no longer computed (fusion weight set to 0.0)
  ⚠ mhal_params no longer saved to model registry
  ⚠ Legacy mhal_z columns in SQL tables will stop receiving new data

DETECTOR ARCHITECTURE (6 Active Detectors):
  Each detector answers a specific "what's wrong?" question:
  
  | Detector | Z-Score   | Fault Type                              |
  |----------|-----------|----------------------------------------|
  | AR1      | ar1_z     | Sensor drift, control loop issues      |
  | PCA-SPE  | pca_spe_z | Correlation/coupling breakdown         |
  | PCA-T²   | pca_t2_z  | Operating point far from center        |
  | IForest  | iforest_z | Rare/novel operating conditions        |
  | GMM      | gmm_z     | Distribution shift, mode confusion     |
  | OMR      | omr_z     | Sensor relationship violations         |

MATHEMATICAL JUSTIFICATION:
  - Mahalanobis D² = (x-μ)ᵀΣ⁻¹(x-μ) in raw feature space
  - PCA-T² = Σᵢ zᵢ²/λᵢ in PCA space (orthogonal components)
  - These are mathematically equivalent (same distance metric)
  - PCA-T² is numerically stable: covariance is diagonal in PCA space
  - MHAL suffered from ill-conditioned covariance with multicollinearity

DEFAULT FUSION WEIGHTS (v10.2.0):
  pca_spe_z: 0.30  (correlation breaks)
  pca_t2_z:  0.20  (multivariate outliers - replaces MHAL)
  ar1_z:     0.20  (temporal patterns)
  iforest_z: 0.15  (rare states)
  omr_z:     0.10  (sensor relationships)
  gmm_z:     0.05  (distribution anomalies)
  mhal_z:    0.00  (DEPRECATED)

CODE CHANGES:
  - core/acm_main.py: Removed all mhal_detector references
  - core/correlation.py: MahalanobisDetector marked DEPRECATED in docstring
  - utils/detector_labels.py: Updated mhal_z description to show deprecated
  - core/model_persistence.py: Removed mhal_params from persistence
  - scripts/test_model_registry.py: Removed mhal_params from test data

MIGRATION:
  No database migration required. Existing mhal_z columns will simply
  receive NULL or 0 values going forward.
