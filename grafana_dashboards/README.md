**Recommended Navigation Flow**:
```
Main Dashboard (Executive View)
    ↓ Drill-Down for Sensor Issues
Sensor Deep-Dive (Diagnostic View)
    ↓ Drill-Down for Full Story
Asset Story (Detailed Narrative)
    ↓ Technical Performance

## Variables

All ACM dashboards use these template variables:

| Variable | Type | Description | Default |
|----------|------|-------------|---------|
| `datasource` | Datasource | MSSQL data source selector | Microsoft SQL Server |
| `equipment` | Query | Equipment filter by EquipID | First equipment in list |

### Equipment Variable Query

```

## Getting Started

### For First-Time Users

1. **Start with Main Dashboard**
   - Open `ACM Main Dashboard`
   - Select your equipment from dropdown
   - Set time range to "Last 7 days"
   - Observe health gauge and RUL

2. **Understand the Colors**
   - Review [Quick Reference](docs/QUICK_REFERENCE.md) color guide
   - Red = Critical, Orange = Warning, Yellow = Caution, Green = Healthy

3. **Drill-Down for Details**
   - If health is declining, click dashboard menu
   - Go to "Sensor Deep-Dive" to see which sensors
   - Review detector heatmap to understand fault types

4. **Check Asset Story**
   - For full narrative and fault-type mapping
   - Understand why detectors are firing

5. **Monitor System Health**
   - Use Operations Monitor to verify ACM is running
   - Check for errors or warnings

### For Troubleshooting

**Scenario: Equipment showing red health**
1. Main Dashboard → Check which detectors are firing
2. Sensor Deep-Dive → See which sensors are contributing
3. Asset Story → Understand the fault type and timeline
4. Operations Monitor → Verify ACM ran recently without errors

**Scenario: No data in dashboards**
1. Operations Monitor → Check recent runs
2. Verify equipment selector is set correctly
3. Adjust time range to match data availability
4. Check ACM_HealthTimeline table for data
