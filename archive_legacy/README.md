This folder holds older or alternate-entry scripts that are not used by the current pipeline.

Kept for reference without cluttering the active ACM working set. If you rely on one of these, move it back to `ACM/` and update the runners accordingly.

Moved from ACM/:

- acm_core_local.py
- acm_score_window.py
