"""

# ============================================================================
# 1. BRANCHING STRATEGY (Git Flow Variant)
# ============================================================================

BRANCHING_STRATEGY = """
ACM uses a modified Git Flow branching model:

PRODUCTION BRANCHES:
  main
    - Always production-ready code
    - Tagged with semantic version (v9.0.0, v9.0.1, etc.)
    - Protected: requires PR review + passing tests before merge
    - Merges only from release branches or hotfix branches
    - Never force-push; always preserve history

FEATURE/DEVELOPMENT BRANCHES:
  feature/<feature-name>
    - New features, enhancements, non-urgent improvements
    - Branched from: main
    - Example: feature/detector-label-consistency, feature/sql-optimization
    - Merge back to: main via PR with --no-ff
    - Lifecycle: Delete after merge

  fix/<bug-name>
    - Bug fixes, critical patches, operational fixes
    - Branched from: main
    - Example: fix/pca-metrics-calculation, fix/run-completion-tracking
    - Merge back to: main via PR with --no-ff
    - Lifecycle: Delete after merge

  refactor/<component>
    - Code refactoring, cleanup, architectural improvements
    - Branched from: main
    - Example: refactor/output-manager, refactor/detector-heads
    - Merge back to: main via PR with --no-ff
    - Lifecycle: Delete after merge

  docs/<topic>
    - Documentation updates, guides, handbooks
    - Branched from: main
    - Example: docs/release-notes, docs/operator-guide
    - Merge back to: main directly (no PR required for minor updates)
    - Lifecycle: Delete after merge

  experimental/<experiment-id>
    - Exploratory work, prototypes, research branches
    - Branched from: main or feature branches
    - Example: experimental/new-detector-approach
    - Merge: Only if experiment successful; otherwise delete
    - Lifecycle: Delete when experiment concluded

NAMING CONVENTIONS:
  ✓ lowercase with hyphens: feature/detector-labels, fix/run-completion
  ✗ CamelCase: feature/DetectorLabels (avoid)
  ✗ underscores: feature/detector_labels (avoid)
  ✗ vague names: feature/update, fix/bug (avoid)

BRANCH PROTECTION RULES FOR MAIN:
  - Require PR review from 1+ maintainer
  - Require all tests to pass
  - Require CI/CD pipeline success (when available)
  - Require branch to be up to date with main
  - Dismiss stale PR approvals when new commits pushed
  - Allow force pushes: only for maintainers, only in rare cases
"""

# ============================================================================
# 2. COMMIT MESSAGE CONVENTIONS
# ============================================================================

COMMIT_CONVENTIONS = """
ACM uses conventional commits format for clear, searchable history:

FORMAT:
  <type>(<scope>): <subject>
  
  <body>
  
  <footer>

TYPES (required):
  feat:      New feature, detector, or capability (minor version bump)
  fix:       Bug fix or issue resolution (patch version bump)
  refactor:  Code restructuring without behavior change (patch version bump)
  perf:      Performance optimization (patch version bump)
  test:      Test additions, fixes, coverage improvements
  docs:      Documentation updates (README, guides, comments)
  chore:     Build, dependencies, tooling (not user-facing)
  ci:        CI/CD pipeline changes
  revert:    Revert a previous commit

SCOPE (optional but recommended):
  Indicates which component/module is affected:
    output-manager, detector-labels, database, sql-integration, feature-engineering,
    fusion, episodes, regimes, drift, forecasting, rul-engine, versioning, etc.

SUBJECT (required):
  - Imperative mood: "add" not "added" or "adds"
  - Lowercase first letter
  - No period at the end
  - Max 50 characters (headline style)
  - Specific and descriptive

BODY (optional but recommended for non-trivial commits):
  - Wrap at 72 characters
  - Explain WHAT changed and WHY, not HOW
  - Reference related issues/PRs: "Fixes #123", "Related to #456"
  - Use bullet points for multiple changes
  - Separate from subject with blank line

FOOTER (optional):
  - Reference issue tracker: "Closes #123"
  - Breaking changes: "BREAKING CHANGE: description"
  - Co-authors: "Co-authored-by: Name <email@example.com>"

EXAMPLES:

  GOOD:
    feat(detector-labels): standardize detector label format across outputs
    
    - Implement get_detector_label() utility for consistent formatting
    - Update extract_dominant_sensor() to preserve full labels
    - Apply changes to ACM_EpisodeDiagnostics table
    - Update Grafana dashboards to use standardized labels
    - Add validation tests for label consistency
    
    Fixes #CRIT-04
    Tested against: 26 production runs

  GOOD:
    fix(run-completion): ensure all runs have CompletedAt timestamp
    
    Mark 4 incomplete runs with NOOP status and zero duration.
    Fixes timestamp ordering issues in dashboards.
    
    Closes #DATA-12

  GOOD:
    refactor(output-manager): extract culprit processing to separate function
    
    No behavior change. Improves maintainability and testability.
    Preparation for enhanced culprit formatting in v9.1.

  BAD:
    Update stuff
    (too vague, no type, no scope)

  BAD:
    feat: Add new feature
    (no scope, not specific)

  BAD:
    FEAT(OutputManager): STANDARDIZE DETECTOR LABEL FORMAT ACROSS OUTPUTS
    (uppercase, too long, unclear)
"""

# ============================================================================
# 3. VERSION MANAGEMENT (Semantic Versioning)
# ============================================================================

VERSION_MANAGEMENT = """
ACM uses Semantic Versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):

FORMAT: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH[-PRERELEASE][+BUILD]
  Example: 9.0.0, 9.1.0, 9.0.1, 9.1.0-rc1, 9.0.0-beta.1

MAJOR VERSION (X._._ → X+1.0.0):
  - Breaking changes in API, database schema, or functionality
  - Backward incompatibility with previous version
  - Example: v8→v9 (detector label format change, database cleanup)
  - Happens: Rarely, planned in advance

MINOR VERSION (_.X._ → _.X+1.0):
  - New features or enhancements (backward compatible)
  - New detectors, algorithms, or capabilities added
  - Configuration enhancements
  - Performance improvements
  - Example: v9.0→v9.1 (new detector, enhanced forecasting)
  - Happens: 2-4 times per development cycle

PATCH VERSION (_._.X → _._.X+1):
  - Bug fixes and patches (backward compatible)
  - Minor improvements and refinements
  - Documentation updates
  - Performance tweaks
  - Example: v9.0.0→v9.0.1 (fix edge case in calibration)
  - Happens: As needed for hotfixes

PRE-RELEASE VERSIONS:
  Format: X.Y.Z-<identifier>
  Examples: 9.0.0-rc1 (release candidate), 9.0.0-beta.1, 9.0.0-alpha
  Usage: Testing phases before stable release
  Lifecycle: Delete after release; don't accumulate old pre-releases

VERSION FILE LOCATION:
  utils/version.py (single source of truth)
    __version__ = "9.0.0"
    __version_date__ = "2025-12-04"
    VERSION_MAJOR, VERSION_MINOR, VERSION_PATCH (parsed from above)

INCREMENTING VERSION:
  1. Update utils/version.py with new version number and date
  2. Update RELEASE_NOTES in utils/version.py
  3. Commit: "chore(version): bump to v9.1.0"
  4. Tag: git tag -a v9.1.0 -m "Version 9.1.0 - <short description>"
  5. Push: git push origin main v9.1.0

VERSION CHECK IN CODE:
  from utils.version import get_version_string, is_compatible
  
  # Log version at startup
  logger.info(f"Starting ACM {get_version_string()}")
  
  # Check compatibility
  if not is_compatible("9.0.0"):
      raise RuntimeError("Incompatible ACM version")

VERSION COMPATIBILITY:
  - Same MAJOR version: fully compatible
  - Different MAJOR version: incompatible, migration required
  - MINOR version: newer is always compatible with older
  - PATCH version: bug fixes, always upgrade available
"""

# ============================================================================
# 4. RELEASE MANAGEMENT
# ============================================================================

RELEASE_MANAGEMENT = """
Professional release management process for ACM:

RELEASE CYCLE:
  1. Feature Development (2-4 weeks)
     - Work on feature/*, fix/*, refactor/* branches
     - Regular PRs to main
     - All tests passing
     - Code reviews complete

  2. Release Branch Creation
     - When ready for release: git checkout -b release/v9.1.0
     - Update version in utils/version.py
     - Update CHANGELOG.md (if exists)
     - Final testing and bugfixes only on release branch
     - Commit: "chore(release): prepare v9.1.0"

  3. Release Tagging
     - Tag release: git tag -a v9.1.0 -m "Release v9.1.0 - <notes>"
     - Push tag: git push origin v9.1.0
     - Tag message includes comprehensive release notes (see example below)

  4. Merge to Main
     - Merge release branch to main: git merge --no-ff release/v9.1.0
     - Commit message: "Merge release v9.1.0"
     - Push: git push origin main

  5. Archive Release Branch
     - Delete local: git branch -d release/v9.1.0
     - Delete remote: git push origin --delete release/v9.1.0

HOTFIX PROCESS (for production issues):
  1. Branch from main: git checkout -b hotfix/v9.0.1
  2. Fix issue and test thoroughly
  3. Update version to v9.0.1
  4. Commit: "fix(hotfix): description" + "chore(version): bump to v9.0.1"
  5. Tag: git tag -a v9.0.1 -m "Hotfix v9.0.1 - critical fix for X"
  6. Merge to main: git merge --no-ff hotfix/v9.0.1
  7. Push: git push origin main v9.0.1
  8. Delete hotfix branch

GIT TAG STRUCTURE:
  Annotated Tags (recommended):
    git tag -a v9.0.0 -m "Release v9.0.0 - description"
    Contains: tagger, date, message (stored in Git database)

  Never use lightweight tags for releases:
    git tag v9.0.0  # Avoid this for releases
    Insufficient metadata and history

TAG MESSAGE FORMAT:
  v9.0.0 - Production Release

  HIGHLIGHTS:
    - Detector label standardization (CRIT-04)
    - Database cleanup (85→79 tables)
    - Equipment name standardization
    - Comprehensive testing suite (30+ tests)

  BREAKING CHANGES:
    None - fully backward compatible

  TESTING:
    All 30+ Python tests passing ✓
    All 8 SQL validation checks passing ✓

  DEPLOYMENT:
    Production-ready. Deploy to environment.

  ISSUES FIXED:
    - Fixes CRIT-04: Detector label inconsistency
    - Fixes DATA-12: Run completion tracking
    - Fixes SCHEMA-08: Backup table cleanup

  NEXT VERSION:
    v9.0.1: Scheduled for hotfixes if needed
    v9.1.0: Next feature release (planned)

DEPLOYMENT FROM TAG:
  # Always deploy from specific tag, never from branch
  git checkout v9.0.0
  # ... deploy to production environment
  # ... validate deployment
  # ... return to main
  git checkout main

VERSIONING IN OUTPUTS:
  All major outputs should include version:
    - SQL run logs: ACM_Runs.ACMVersion
    - Output CSV headers: # Generated by ACM v9.0.0
    - Log files: [ACM v9.0.0] Starting run...
    - Grafana dashboards: Footer showing ACM version
    - API responses: "version": "9.0.0"
