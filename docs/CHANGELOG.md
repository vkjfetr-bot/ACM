## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Continuous Learning Architecture** (2025-11-29):
  - **Purpose**: Enable ACM to continuously learn from accumulated data in batch mode, updating models and thresholds every batch
  - **Implementation**:
    - Added `_batch_mode()` and `_continuous_learning_enabled()` helper functions to detect batch runner context
    - Added `_calculate_adaptive_thresholds()` standalone function for threshold calculation independent of auto-tune section
    - Modified model cache logic to disable caching when continuous learning is enabled (`force_retraining = True`)
    - Moved threshold calculation from auto-tune section (only runs during coldstart) to post-fusion section (runs every batch)
    - Implemented threshold update frequency control via `threshold_update_interval` config option
    - Added batch number tracking via `ACM_BATCH_NUM` environment variable set by sql_batch_runner
    - Thresholds now calculated on accumulated data (train + score combined) in continuous learning mode
    - Added logging for threshold update decisions and frequency control
  - **Config Schema**:
    - `continuous_learning.enabled`: Enable/disable continuous learning (default: True in batch mode)
    - `continuous_learning.model_update_interval`: Batches between model retraining (default: 1)
    - `continuous_learning.threshold_update_interval`: Batches between threshold updates (default: 1)
  - **Impact**:
    - ✅ Models retrain on accumulated data every batch (or at configurable intervals)
    - ✅ Thresholds recalculate on growing dataset every batch (or at configurable intervals)
    - ✅ Fixes empty ACM_ThresholdMetadata table issue (thresholds only calculated during coldstart before)
    - ✅ Enables true online learning architecture where models and thresholds evolve with data
    - ✅ Grafana dashboard panels now show threshold evolution over time
    - ✅ Each batch = validate current data + retrain models + update thresholds + move forward
  - **Architecture Change**: Paradigm shift from "train once, score many" to "continuous learning on sliding window"
  - **Performance**: Increased computation per batch due to model retraining, controlled via update intervals

- **FCST-15 & RUL-01: Artifact Cache for SQL-Only Mode** (2025-11-15):
  - **Purpose**: Enable forecast and RUL modules to work in SQL-only mode without file system dependencies
  - **Implementation**: 
    - Added `_artifact_cache` dictionary to `OutputManager` to store DataFrames in memory
    - Implemented `get_cached_table()` method to retrieve cached DataFrames for downstream modules
    - Added `clear_artifact_cache()` and `list_cached_tables()` helper methods
    - Modified `write_dataframe()` to automatically cache all written tables
    - Updated `forecast.run()` to accept output_manager and use cached scores.csv
    - Updated `_load_health_timeline()` in RUL estimator to use cached health_timeline.csv
    - Modified `acm_main.py` to pass output_manager to forecast and RUL modules
  - **Impact**:
    - ✅ Forecast module no longer requires scores.csv file on disk
    - ✅ RUL module no longer requires health_timeline.csv file on disk
    - ✅ Both modules work seamlessly in SQL-only mode
    - ✅ Cache persists across pipeline stages within a single run
    - ✅ Enables true SQL-only deployments without temporary file writes
  - **Test Coverage**: Added comprehensive test suite in `tests/test_artifact_cache.py` (6 tests, all passing)
  - **Documentation**: FORECAST_RUL_AUDIT_SUMMARY.md updated with implementation status

### Fixed
- **DET-08: Mahalanobis High Condition Number** (2025-11-10):
  - **Issue**: Extremely high condition numbers indicated near-singular covariance matrices (FD_FAN: 4.80e+30, GAS_TURBINE: 4.47e+13)
  - **Discovery**: Regularization already implemented and config-driven via `models.mahl.regularization` (default 0.001 too weak)
  - **Fix**: Increased regularization from 0.001 → 1.0 (1000x stronger) in `configs/config_table.csv`
  - **Results**: FD_FAN condition number 4.80e+30 → 8.26e+27 (580x improvement)
  - **Changes**:
    - Added `models.mahl.regularization=1.0` config for EquipID 0 and 1
    - Added debug logging in `core/acm_main.py` line 1191 to show regularization value
    - Updated warning thresholds in `core/correlation.py` (1e10 warning, 1e8 info)
  - **Impact**: Improved Mahalanobis detector numerical stability; reduces risk of NaN/Inf in distance calculations

- **DEBT-13: River Weight Config Cleanup** (2025-11-10):
  - **Issue**: Config had `fusion.weights.river_hst_z=0.1` but `river.enabled=False` (streaming not implemented)
  - **Impact**: Misleading config - detector never runs but weight was set
  - **Fix**: Changed weight from 0.1 → 0.0 with reason "Disabled - streaming feature not implemented"
  - **Note**: River HST detector is planned feature (STREAM-01, STREAM-02), currently disabled. Fusion already handles missing streams gracefully.

- **DASH-21: PCA Explained Variance Panel Error** (2025-11-19):
  - **Issue**: Grafana panel "PCA Explained Variance" failed with `mssql: Invalid column name 'MetricType'` and showed "No data".
  - **Root Cause**: Deployed SQL schema for `ACM_PCA_Metrics` missing `MetricType` column (older schema) while dashboard query expected new format: rows keyed by `(ComponentName, MetricType)` where `MetricType ∈ {VarianceRatio, CumulativeVariance, ComponentCount}`.
  - **Fix**: Added migration script `scripts/sql/patches/2025-11-19_add_metric_type_to_pca_metrics.sql` that recreates table with correct schema if `MetricType` absent and adds PK `(RunID, EquipID, ComponentName, MetricType)`.
  - **Dashboard**: Verified existing query in `grafana_dashboards/asset_health_dashboard.json` is valid against new schema (no change needed once column exists).
  - **Impact**: PCA variance and cumulative variance bars render again; removes blocking error tooltip; enables drill-down on PCA component coverage.
  - **Operator Action**: Run the patch script on affected SQL instances before next pipeline run:
    ```sql
    :r scripts/sql/patches/2025-11-19_add_metric_type_to_pca_metrics.sql
    ```
  - **Data Safety**: Existing rows preserved via staged copy (old table renamed then reinserted); no loss of historical PCA metrics.
  - **Follow-up**: Add monitoring to detect schema drift (BACKLOG: DASH-22) and surface missing columns proactively in run logs.
\n+- **SQL-59: RunLog RunID Type Clash (coldstart failure)** (2025-11-19):
  - **Issue**: Pipeline start failed with `Operand type clash: uniqueidentifier is incompatible with bigint` when executing `usp_ACM_StartRun`.
  - **Root Cause**: Database had legacy `RunLog.RunID BIGINT IDENTITY` while stored procedure + Python expect `RunLog.RunID UNIQUEIDENTIFIER` (guid). Insert attempted to put a GUID into bigint column.
  - **Symptoms**: Coldstart retry loop exhausted (10 attempts), run aborted before scoring; no RunLog row inserted; downstream tables empty.
  - **Fix**: Added migration script `scripts/sql/patches/2025-11-19_migrate_runlog_runid_to_uniqueidentifier.sql` to convert bigint RunID to GUID safely (adds `RunID_guid`, migrates values, renames, recreates PK). Idempotent: no-op if already GUID.
  - **Operator Action**:
    ```sql
    :r scripts/sql/patches/2025-11-19_migrate_runlog_runid_to_uniqueidentifier.sql
    :r scripts/sql/20_stored_procs.sql   -- (optional redeploy to ensure latest SP signature)
    ```
    Then rerun: `python -m core.acm_main --equip FD_FAN --enable-report`.
  - **Impact**: Start-run succeeds; RunID values become stable GUIDs across related tables; resolves coldstart blocking error.
  - **Data Safety**: Legacy bigint RunIDs preserved in `RunID_bigint_backup` column for audit; can be dropped later (backlog item SQL-60).
  - **Follow-up**: Add runtime schema check to log actionable warning when detected mismatch instead of hard failure (BACKLOG: SQL-61).

### Added
- **SQL-57: Enhanced Forecasting Tables** (2025-11-14):
  - Added permanent SQL tables for enhanced forecasting outputs: `ACM_EnhancedFailureProbability_TS`, `ACM_FailureCausation`, `ACM_EnhancedMaintenanceRecommendation`, and `ACM_RecommendedActions`.
  - Extends `scripts/sql/57_create_forecast_and_rul_tables.sql` so SQL-mode runs can persist failure probabilities, detector causation, prescriptive maintenance windows, and recommended action rows for Grafana dashboards.
  - Paves the way for `core/output_manager.OutputManager` to dual-write the enhanced DataFrames once hooks are wired up.
- **DET-09: Adaptive Parameter Tuning** (2025-11-10):
  - **Purpose**: Hands-off, continuous self-monitoring and auto-adjustment of model hyperparameters
  - **Philosophy**: No separate commissioning modes - ACM adapts continuously during normal operation
  - **Implementation**: Integrated health checks after model training in every batch run
  - **Components**:
    - `core/correlation.py`: Store condition number in detector for monitoring
    - `core/acm_main.py`: Adaptive tuning section after model training
  - **Features**:
    - **Condition Number Monitoring**: 
      - Critical (>1e28): 10x regularization increase
      - High (>1e20): 5x regularization increase
      - Automatic adjustment prevents numerical instability
    - **NaN Rate Checking**: Scores sample data to detect NaN production (>1% triggers warning)
    - **Automatic Config Updates**: Writes parameter changes to `config_table.csv` with:
      - `UpdatedBy = ADAPTIVE_TUNING`
      - `ChangeReason` = Specific health metric that triggered adjustment
      - Timestamp and old/new values logged
    - **No Manual Intervention**: ACM detects model drift, transient modes, bad data automatically
  - **User Philosophy**: "We want to always ensure our model does not just drift away and we always know what the normal is. We should know when we are in transient mode. We should know when the data is bad. This is part of hands off approach that is central to ACM."
  - **Impact**: 
    - Eliminates manual parameter tuning

- **CFG-07: Future Data Grace Window** (2025-11-14):
  - **Issue**: SQL-mode replay dropped every row newer than the current wall clock, preventing historical backfills because historian data extends into 2026–2027.
  - **Change**: Introduced `runtime.future_grace_minutes` (default 0) and taught `core/output_manager.py` to extend the "now" cutoff by that many minutes before filtering future timestamps.
  - **Config**: Global default set to `1,051,200` minutes (~2 years) in `configs/config_table.csv`; production values can be tuned per equipment via `ACM_Config`.
  - **Impact**: Allows Grafana/SQL batch replays to ingest archived months ahead of real time without hacking system clocks, while still keeping the guardrail for operators who leave the grace window at 0.
    - Continuous adaptation to data characteristics
    - Equipment-agnostic (parameters adapt per equipment automatically)
    - Production-ready self-tuning system
  - **Parameters**: Mahalanobis regularization, PCA n_components, IForest n_estimators, GMM k_max, AR1 window
  - **Integration**: Runs irrespective of batch/streaming mode, saves optimal params to config_table.csv
  - **Priority**: 🔴 Critical - Required for production deployment
  - **Estimate**: 4 hours implementation, 2-4 hours commissioning per equipment

- **Incremental Batch Testing Protocol** (2025-11-10):
  - **Purpose**: Validate ACM's cold-start and warm-start behavior for production deployment
  - **Tool**: `scripts/test_incremental_batches.py` (320 lines)
  - **Features**:
    - Splits train/score data into N equal batches
    - Tests cold start (clear models) vs warm start (reuse cache)
    - Tracks cache hit rates and performance metrics
    - Generates CSV reports with detailed analysis
  - **Validation Results** (FD_FAN, 3 batches):
    - ✅ Model caching works correctly (100% cache hit rate)
    - ✅ Cache validation prevents incompatible reuse
    - ✅ Adaptive tuning policy handles distribution shifts
    - ✅ Performance: 0.086s model loading vs ~20s training
  - **Documentation**: `docs/BATCH_TESTING_VALIDATION.md`
  - **Production Impact**: ACM is ready for incremental batch processing

### Added
- **Overall Model Residual (OMR) detector** (`models/omr.py`, `docs/OMR_DETECTOR.md`):
  - **Purpose**: Multivariate health indicator capturing sensor correlation patterns missed by univariate detectors (AR1, PCA SPE, Mahalanobis).
  - **Architecture**: 
    - Three model types with auto-selection: PLS (default for correlated sensors), Ridge (fast for large datasets), PCA (high-dimensional data).
    - Auto-selection logic: PCA if n_features > n_samples; Linear if n_samples > 1000 and n_features < 20; PLS otherwise.
  - **Training**: Fits multivariate model on healthy training data (optional regime filtering), computes reconstruction error baseline.
  - **Scoring**: Returns z-scores normalized by training residual std + per-sensor squared residual contributions for attribution.
  - **Root Cause Attribution**: `get_top_contributors(timestamp, top_n=5)` API identifies which sensors drive OMR deviations.
  - **Auto-enable/disable**: Lazy evaluation based on `fusion.weights.omr_z` (0.0 = disabled by default; >0.0 = auto-enabled).
  - **Integration**: Seamless pipeline integration (lazy evaluation, fitting, scoring, calibration, fusion, model persistence, contribution export).
  - **Outputs**: 
    - `omr_contributions.csv`: Per-timestamp sensor squared residuals (heatmap-ready).
    - `omr_top_contributors.csv`: Top 5 culprit sensors per high-OMR episode with contribution magnitudes.
  - **Configuration**:
    ```csv
    fusion,weights.omr_z,0.0,float  # Set >0 to enable (e.g., 0.10 for 10% weight)
    models,omr.model_type,auto,string  # auto/pls/linear/pca
    models,omr.n_components,5,int  # Latent components for PLS/PCA
    models,omr.min_samples,100,int  # Minimum training samples
    ```
  - **Testing**: `tests/test_omr.py` with 7 test cases (fit/score, persistence, attribution, auto-selection, missing data handling) - all passing.
  - **Documentation**: `docs/OMR_DETECTOR.md` (600+ lines) covering architecture, usage examples, performance characteristics, troubleshooting guide.
  - **Use Cases**: 
    - Equipment with known sensor correlations (pumps: vibration ↔ flow; turbines: temperature ↔ pressure)
    - Multiple sensors drifting together (coordinated degradation)
    - Broken correlations (sensor A normal, sensor B normal, but relationship broken)
    - Root cause attribution critical for maintenance decisions
  - **Performance**: Training 50-200ms (1000 samples × 10 sensors); Scoring 1-5ms per batch; Memory < 5MB.
- `scripts/chunk_replay.py` to replay chunked historian batches with optional parallel assets.

### Changed
- `sensor_defects.csv` now reports detector channels/families instead of mislabeling them as sensors.
- README chunk replay instructions refreshed for hands-off cold start + score sequencing.
- **OMR lazy evaluation**: Detector only initialized/fitted/scored when `fusion.weights.omr_z > 0` (automatic inclusion/exclusion).
- **README.md**: Added OMR to detector list, configuration examples, output artifacts (tables 26-27), pipeline overview.
- **Model persistence**: Added OMR serialization to versioned model cache (joblib-based, includes sklearn models + metadata).

## [1.2.0] - 2025-10-28 - SQL Integration & Project Cleanup

### Added
- **SQL Server integration** (Latin1_General_CI_AI collation):
  - `configs/sql_connection.ini`: Plain-text credentials file for server/database/SA user (overrides YAML config).
  - `core/sql_client.py`: Enhanced with INI reader, automatic ODBC driver fallback (18→17→SQL Server), database fallback if target DB doesn't exist.
  - SQL scripts in `scripts/sql/`:
    - `00_create_database.sql`: ACM database creation with CI_AI collation.
    - `10_core_tables.sql`: Core tables (Equipments, RunLog, ScoresTS, DriftTS, AnomalyEvents, RegimeEpisodes, PCA_Model, PCA_Components, PCA_Metrics, RunStats, ConfigLog).
    - `15_config_tables.sql`: Configuration management tables (ACM_Config, ACM_ConfigHistory).
    - `20_stored_procs.sql`: Run lifecycle procedures (usp_ACM_StartRun, usp_ACM_FinalizeRun, usp_ACM_RegisterEquipment).
    - `25_equipment_discovery_procs.sql`: XStudio_DOW integration procedures (usp_ListEquipmentTypes, usp_GetEquipmentInstances, usp_GetEquipmentTagMappings, usp_SyncEquipmentFromDOW).
    - `30_views.sql`: Analytics views (vw_AnomalyEvents, vw_Scores, vw_RunSummary).
  - `scripts/sql/verify_acm_connection.py`: Connection verification script.
  - `docs/sql/SQL_SETUP.md`: Complete SQL setup guide with connection configuration, equipment discovery workflow, and Python integration examples.
- **XStudio_DOW integration architecture**:
  - Discovery stored procedures read equipment metadata from XStudio_DOW (Equipment_Type_Mst_Tbl, {Type}_Mst_Tbl, {Type}_Tag_Mapping_Tbl).
  - ACM runs per equipment instance with automatic syncing to ACM.Equipments table.
  - READ-ONLY access to XStudio_DOW; all analytics results written to ACM database.

### Changed
- **Project structure cleanup**:
  - Moved all root-level analysis scripts to `scripts/analysis/` (analyze_episodes.py, check_zscore.py, create_chunked_data.py, generate_evolution_proof.py, run_batches.py, simulate_batch_runs.py).
  - Moved all root-level test scripts to `scripts/testing/` (test_coldstart*.py, test_config_dict.py).
  - Moved demo scripts to `scripts/demos/` (demo_coldstart.py).
  - Root directory now contains only core project files (configs, core, models, utils, docs).

### Fixed
- SQL connection string driver formatting (KeyError on ODBC driver name).
- Database connection fallback when ACM database doesn't exist yet (allows connection to server for initial setup).
- ODBC driver auto-detection and graceful fallback across Driver 18/17/SQL Server.

### Docs
- README updated: SQL mode now marked as "ready for deployment" with reference to SQL_SETUP.md.
- CHANGELOG updated with full SQL integration details and project restructuring.

## [1.1.6] - 2025-10-28 - Regime Transitions + Drift Events

### Added
- `tables/regime_transition_matrix.csv`: Long-format transition counts and probabilities between regimes (excludes self-transitions).
- `tables/regime_dwell_stats.csv`: Dwell duration statistics by regime (runs, mean/median/min/max seconds).
- `tables/drift_events.csv`: Peak events extracted from the CUSUM drift series using a threshold heuristic; empty when no peaks.

### Changed
- Output count now up to 23 tables (some may be empty depending on data).

### Docs
- README updated with new tables and revised counts.

## [1.1.5] - 2025-10-28 - Robustness & Calibration Tables

### Added
- `tables/detector_correlation.csv`: Pairwise Pearson correlation of detector z-streams (long format: det_a, det_b, pearson_r). Helps identify redundant or tightly coupled detectors and informs fusion/weighting.
- `tables/calibration_summary.csv`: Per-detector calibration/scale summary (mean, std, p95, p99, configured clip_z, and % of samples with |z| >= clip_z). Useful to spot saturation and calibration drift across runs.

### Docs
- README updated: Tables count increased to 20; new tables documented under "Robustness & Calibration".

## [1.1.4] - 2025-10-28 - Adaptive Rolling Baseline (Cold-start default)

### Added
- Adaptive rolling baseline buffer persisted at `artifacts/<EQUIP>/models/baseline_buffer.csv`.
  - When training data is missing or too small (`runtime.baseline.min_points`, default 300), TRAIN is bootstrapped from the buffer; if no buffer exists yet, it seeds from the head of SCORE.
  - Buffer is updated after every run with the latest raw SCORE rows and pruned by retention policy: `runtime.baseline.window_hours` (default 72h) and `runtime.baseline.max_points` (default 100k).
 - Refit policy marker: when quality degrades, a `refit_requested.flag` is written under `artifacts/<EQUIP>/models/` so the next run bypasses cache and retrains.
 - Minimal storage abstraction (`core/storage.py`) for file-mode writes of `scores.csv`, `episodes.csv`, and `models/score_stream.csv` to ease future SQL shift.

### Notes
- This makes “always cold start” practical: the first model evolves continuously as new batches arrive without manual curation.
- File and SQL modes both maintain the same stable buffer under the equipment’s `models/` folder.
- Stable artifacts remain under `artifacts/<EQUIP>/models/vN/…`; per-run `run_*/models/` only contains lightweight staging (e.g., `score_stream.csv`, regime JSON metadata).

## [1.1.3] - 2025-10-28 - Regime Stability + Scatter Visualization

### Added
- Regime stability metrics table `tables/regime_stability.csv` with label churn rate and average/median state durations (overall and per-regime).
- State transition smoothing (min-dwell) applied to regime labels; configurable via `regimes.smoothing`:
  - `passes` (int, default 1)
  - `min_dwell_samples` (int, default 0)
  - `min_dwell_seconds` (float, optional)
- New chart `charts/regime_scatter.png`: 2D PCA scatter of operating states colored by regime health (healthy/suspect/critical) or labels as fallback.

### Changed
- `core/regimes.label()` now applies both label smoothing and transition smoothing using dwell thresholds.
- README updated: Backlog item 5 completed; artifacts list now shows 18 tables and 14 charts with the new regime assets.

## [1.1.2] - 2025-10-28 - Data Quality Guardrails

### Added
- Data quality summary table `tables/data_quality.csv` with per-sensor null counts/%, std, and interpolation context.

### Changed
- Added guardrail warnings:
  - Warn when the scoring window starts before or overlaps the training window end.
  - Warn when any training sensor has very low variance (std < 1e-6).

### Notes
- Initial guardrails are non-blocking and focus on visibility. Further actions (auto-drop columns, stricter gating) can be enabled later.

## [1.1.1] - 2025-10-28 - Outputs Always-On + SQL Mode Artifacts

### Changed
- Removed report gating: tables and charts are now generated unconditionally after each run (no config flag or CLI switch required).
- In SQL mode, a local `run_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS` folder is now also created under `artifacts/<EQUIP>/` so operator-friendly tables (`tables/*.csv`) and charts (`charts/*.png`) are available for inspection. Core telemetry continues to upsert into SQL as before.

### Notes
- Full upsert of the new operator tables into SQL is not yet wired (schema mapping required). Current behavior keeps them on disk for dashboard ingestion; propose adding a mapping in a follow-up so these tables can be upserted to dedicated SQL tables.


## [1.1.0] - 2025-10-28 - Enhanced Human-Friendly Visuals

### ✨ New
- Added non-technical, sensor-focused and defect-focused outputs to make issues obvious at a glance without ML jargon.

Tables (added to `tables/`):
- `defect_summary.csv` – Single-row executive summary: status (HEALTHY/CAUTION/ALERT), severity, health (current/avg/min), episodes, worst sensor, counts of Good/Watch/Alert points.
- `defect_timeline.csv` – Timeline of zone transitions (GOOD → WATCH → ALERT) with start/end events and health at each transition.
- `sensor_defects.csv` – Per-sensor defect analysis with severity class (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW), violation counts/%, max/avg/current z, active flags.

Charts (added to `charts/`):
- `defect_dashboard.png` – 4-panel executive dashboard (current health gauge, Good/Watch/Alert pie, health trend with zones, summary stats).
- `sensor_defect_heatmap.png` – Time × sensor heatmap (red/yellow/green) showing when each sensor was problematic.
- `defect_severity.png` – Color-coded horizontal bars by sensor with severity legend and percentage labels.
- `sensor_sparklines.png` – Grid of raw sensor time series with median and IQR shading; focuses on real signals, not model outputs.
- `health_distribution_over_time.png` – Stacked area of Good/Watch/Alert share per period with health quantile bands (P10/P50/P90).

### 🔧 Changed
- README updated to reflect "10 charts + 15 tables per run (human-friendly, sensor-focused)" and to document new artifacts.
- Kept all existing charts/tables; new visuals are additive and operator-friendly (simple labels, clear colors).

### ✅ Validation
- Verified generation on FD_FAN and GAS_TURBINE single-batch runs; new artifacts produced alongside existing ones.
- Observed defects are now immediately visible in dashboard and heatmap (e.g., GAS_TURBINE: MHAL shows CRITICAL severity with high violation rate).

## [1.0.0] - 2025-10-27 - Phase 1 Complete 🎉

### ✨ New Features

#### Cold-Start Mode (CRITICAL)

- **CSV storage** - `configs/config_table.csv` with EquipID column for equipment-specific parameters

#### Model Persistence & Versioning (CRITICAL)
- **Version-based cache** - Models saved to `artifacts/{EQUIP}/models/v{N}/*.pkl` with auto-incrementing versions
- **Config signature validation** - Cache invalidates when config changes (hash of tunable parameters)

- **Performance gain** - 5-8s speedup on cache hits (6-8s training → 1-2s loading)
- **Implementation** - `core/model_persistence.py` with `ModelVersionManager` class

#### Autonomous Tuning (CRITICAL)
- **Quality-driven parameter adjustment** - 3 operational tuning rules:
  1. High saturation (>5%) → Increase `clip_z` by 20% (cap at 20.0)
  2. Low silhouette (<0.2) → Increase `k_max` by 2 (cap at 15)
  3. High anomaly rate (>20%) → Increase fusion threshold by 20%

### 🔧 Changed

#### Data Loading
- **Cold-start detection** - `core/data_io.py` now detects missing `train_csv` and auto-splits `score_csv` 60/40
- **Split logic** - First 60% chronologically used for training, last 40% held out for validation
- **Logging** - Clear messages for cold-start mode: "[DATA] Cold-start split: X train rows, Y score rows"

#### Configuration Management
- **Equipment ID mapping** - `core/acm_main.py` `_get_equipment_id()` computes deterministic IDs from equipment names
- **Config loading** - `_load_config()` enhanced to accept `equipment_name` parameter and merge asset-specific configs
- **CSV structure** - `configs/config_table.csv` now includes `EquipID` column for equipment-specific overrides

#### Previous Changes (Pre-Phase 1)
- **Architecture Consolidation** - Moved `report/outputs.py` to `core/outputs.py`, deleted report/ folder entirely. Simplified project structure.
- **Model Versioning & Persistence (CRITICAL)** - Created `core/model_persistence.py` with `ModelVersionManager` class. Models saved to `artifacts/{EQUIP}/models/v{N}/*.joblib` with auto-incrementing versions. Manifest system tracks metadata (timestamp, config signature, quality metrics). Cold-start resolution: load cached models on subsequent runs (5-8 second speedup). Includes config validation to invalidate stale cache.
- **Autonomous Model Re-evaluation (CRITICAL)** - Created `core/model_evaluation.py` with `ModelQualityMonitor` class. Monitors 5 quality dimensions: detector saturation, anomaly rate, regime quality, episode validity, config changes. Auto-retrain triggers when quality degrades (saturation >5%, anomaly rate out of bounds, silhouette <0.15, episode coverage >80%, config changed). Quality reports logged to manifest.
- **Output consolidation system** (`core/outputs.py`) - Single unified module generating 11 SQL-ready CSV tables and 5 PNG charts. Replaces fragmented analytics/charts/chart_tables system.
- **Episode threshold configuration** - Added `episodes.cpd` config section with `k_sigma=2.0, h_sigma=12.0` for CUSUM-based episode detection (was using defaults causing false positives).
- **Config-as-table migration** - `ConfigDict` class with CSV backend (`configs/config_table.csv`), backward compatible with dict access, supports `update_param()` with audit trail.
- **Tabular configuration documentation** (`docs/CONFIG_AS_TABLE.md`) - Complete specification for equipment-specific overrides and autonomous tuning.
- **Episode fix documentation** (`EPISODE_THRESHOLD_FIX.md`, `docs/EPISODE_FIX_COMPARISON.md`) - Detailed analysis of episode threshold tuning.
- **Output consolidation documentation** (`docs/OUTPUT_CONSOLIDATION.md`, `docs/LEGACY_CLEANUP.md`) - Complete implementation and cleanup guides.
- Optional `runtime.reuse_model_fit` flag caches fitted detectors for subsequent file-mode runs (stored under `artifacts/<equip>/run/models/detectors.joblib`).
- Documentation roadmap for regime-state modelling (curated feature basis, model persistence, health labels).
- Regime feature basis builder (PCA scores + optional raw tags), persisted `RegimeModel`, `models/regime_model.json`, and `tables/regime_summary.csv` export.
- Regime quality gates (silhouette/Davies–Bouldin thresholds) and label smoothing plus cached metadata.
- **Comprehensive validation report** (`docs/VALIDATION_REPORT.md`) analyzing FD_FAN run outputs with detailed findings on z-score saturation and episode detection.
- **Detailed TODO tracking** in README with 4-phase completion checklist (Critical/High/Medium/Low priority items).
- **Validation summary section** in README documenting current run performance and known issues.
- **All-NaN column guard** in feature imputation to prevent propagating NaNs into detectors.
- **Config signature validation** - Hash models/features/preprocessing sections to detect config changes and invalidate stale cached models.
- **Adaptive z-score clipping** - Compute z_cap = max(default, train_p99 * 1.5) per detector to prevent saturation when test distribution diverges from training baseline.

### Changed
- **MAJOR REFACTOR:** Output generation consolidated from 12 files (2,100 lines) to 2 files (520 lines). Removed report/html.py, builder.py, charts.py, analytics.py, chart_tables.py, pipeline.py, report.py, template.html, themes.py, legacy_fullreport.py. Single entry point: `report.generate_all_outputs()`.
- **Episode detection fixed** - CUSUM parameters tuned from defaults (k_sigma=0.5, h_sigma=5.0) to production values (k_sigma=2.0, h_sigma=12.0). Result: episodes 1→0, coverage 97%→0% on healthy FD_FAN test data.
- **acm_main.py simplified** - HTML report generation (60+ lines) replaced with 10-line call to consolidated output module.
- **ConfigDict JSON serialization** - Added `_make_json_serializable()` recursive converter to handle nested ConfigDict objects in meta.json writes.
- **Docs:** Rewrote README and backbone design notes to mirror the current file-mode implementation and backlog priorities.
- **Docs:** Clarified that reporting modules are staging assets and that SQL/River features are pending work.
- **Docs:** Updated README with quick links, status badges, and phase-based completion tracking.
- Score calibrator now relies on robust MAD scaling with optional z-clipping and per-regime medians, preventing the 1.0 saturation seen with the previous quantile-only approach.
- `scores.csv` now includes `regime_label`/`regime_state`; episodes use true timestamps and carry regime metadata; anomaly top table reuses culprit tags.

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL:** Episode false positives - Single 136-day episode covering 97% of healthy test data (fused z-max=1.83). Root cause: Missing `episodes.cpd` config caused default CUSUM params (k_sigma=0.5, h_sigma=5.0) - too sensitive. Fix: Added config with k_sigma=2.0, h_sigma=12.0. Result: 0 episodes on healthy data.
- **CRITICAL:** Calibration architecture bug - Calibrators now fit on TRAIN data instead of SCORE data (lines 632-698 in acm_main.py). Previous version fit calibrators on test scores, causing extreme z-scores (max=4e+29). Fixed flow: score(TRAIN) → fit_calibrator(TRAIN) → score(SCORE) → transform(SCORE). Result: z-scores now reasonable (max=12), thresholds valid.
- **Adaptive z-score clipping** - Compute TRAIN P99 z-scores and set clip_z=max(default, 1.5*train_p99, cap=50). Implemented at lines 648-666. Result: clip_z=12 for FD_FAN (was 8), IsolationForest saturation reduced from 15%→3.2%.
- **SQL mode run_dir gating** - SQL mode now skips run_dir creation (lines 271-288). File mode creates timestamped run directories, SQL mode sets run_dir=None and persists to database. Guards added where run_dir is used.
- **PCA scaler metadata** - Dynamically capture actual scaler class name (lines 1138-1148). Was hardcoded as "StandardScaler", now reads pca_detector.scaler.__class__.__name__ for accuracy.
- **Critical:** Heartbeat crash when disabled - Added `_started` flag and `is_alive()` guard to prevent RuntimeError on join() of non-started thread.
- **Critical:** PCA TRAIN metrics computation - Now computes TRAIN raw scores after fitting, uses dedicated calibrators for accurate P95 baselines (was incorrectly refitting on SCORE data).
- **score_stream.csv timestamp format** - Explicitly format `ts` column with `strftime()` since `date_format` only applies to index.
- File-mode resampling guard now honours `runtime.max_fill_ratio` without referencing undefined globals.
- Fusion module imports `Mapping` explicitly to satisfy type checking/runtime usage.
- River streaming prototype guards optional imports, builds the transformer union correctly, and iterates over rows safely.
- Episode timestamps now retain real chronology; regime state health labels only apply when clustering quality passes thresholds; episodes inherit severity from suspect/critical regimes.

### Removed
- **HTML report generation** - Deleted all HTML report infrastructure (no longer generating HTML).
- **Legacy reporting modules** - Removed 10 files totaling ~1,500 lines: analytics.py, builder.py, charts.py, chart_tables.py, html.py, legacy_fullreport.py, pipeline.py, report.py, template.html, themes.py.

### Known gaps
- **Remaining saturation:** PCA/Mhal/GMM detectors still saturate at 26-28% (z≥12) after adaptive clipping. This indicates test data genuinely diverges from training baseline (distribution shift). Consider: per-regime calibration review, extended training window, or anomaly confirmation via domain expert.
- **Regime model persistence:** Only JSON metadata persisted; sklearn objects not saved to `.joblib` (TODO #3).
- **Autonomous parameter tuning:** Not yet implemented - requires evaluation loop to adjust config based on run outputs (TODO #4).
- **Detector redundancy:** Mahalanobis and GMM nearly identical (r=1.000); consider disabling one.
- River streaming, SQL ingestion, and automated evaluation remain in progress.
- Testing/CI is intentionally deferred per project direction.
