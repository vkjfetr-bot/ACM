# Regime Identification Analysis & Recommendations

**Date**: 2026-01-20  
**Scope**: Comprehensive review of regime detection logic, stability, categorization, and predictability  
**System**: ACM v11.3.x Regime Detection Module (`core/regimes.py`)

---

## Executive Summary

The ACM regime identification system uses **HDBSCAN** (primary) and **GMM** (fallback) to discover operating regimes from equipment sensor data. While the architecture is sound, there are **5 critical issues** affecting regime stability, categorization consistency, and predictability:

1. **Rare regime fragmentation** - Transient regimes (startup/shutdown) are lost due to subsampling
2. **Health-state regime coupling** - Health variables create regime drift instead of stable operating states
3. **Confidence-assignment inconsistency** - Low-confidence points assigned anyway, masking uncertainty
4. **Label alignment failures** - Regime IDs permute across refits, breaking temporal consistency
5. **Smoothing order dependencies** - Two-stage smoothing has undocumented order requirements

**Impact**: False positive rate remains ~30-50%, regime stability is lower than expected, and operators cannot trust regime labels for fault context.

---

## 1. How is New Data Categorized?

### Current Process

1. **Feature Basis Construction** (`build_feature_basis`)
   - Extracts operating variables (load, speed, pressure) via tag taxonomy
   - Excludes condition indicators (vibration, temperature, bearing health)
   - **v11.3.0 NEW**: Adds health-state variables (ensemble_z, trend, quartile)
   - Scales all features uniformly via StandardScaler

2. **Clustering** (`fit_regime_model`)
   - **HDBSCAN** (primary): Density-based clustering, auto-detects k
   - **GMM** (fallback): Gaussian mixture, uses BIC for k selection
   - Computes cluster centers (centroids for HDBSCAN, means for GMM)

3. **Prediction** (`predict_regime_with_confidence`)
   - Scales new data with fitted scaler
   - Assigns to nearest cluster center
   - Computes confidence based on distance to center
   - **v11.3.1**: Flags novel points (distance > P95 threshold)

### Issues Identified

#### Issue 1.1: Health-State Regime Coupling (NEW in v11.3.0)

**Problem**: Adding health-state variables (ensemble_z, health_trend, health_quartile) to regime clustering creates **regime drift** instead of stable operating states.

```python
# v11.3.0: Health state added to regime features
features_with_health['health_ensemble_z'] = np.clip(ensemble_z, -3, 3)
features_with_health['health_trend'] = rolling_mean(ensemble_z, 20)
features_with_health['health_quartile'] = pd.qcut(ensemble_z, q=4)
```

**Impact**:
- Equipment at Load=50%, Health=95% gets Regime A
- Same equipment at Load=50%, Health=20% gets Regime B
- **Result**: Regime labels change as health degrades, breaking stability assumption
- **Consequence**: Regime-based thresholds, forecasts, and episode context become invalid

**Root Cause**: Confusion between **operating regime** (load/speed) and **health state** (degradation level). The fix in v11.3.0 was intended to reduce false positives at regime transitions, but instead created a new problem where regimes are no longer stable.

**Recommendation**:
```python
# OPTION A: Separate health tracking (RECOMMENDED)
# - Regimes = f(operating_variables) ONLY
# - Health tracked separately per regime
# - Episode classification uses both: (regime_id, health_state)

# OPTION B: Weighted features (ALTERNATIVE)
# - Reduce health feature weight to 10-20% of total
# - Prevents health from dominating regime definition
# - Requires careful tuning per equipment type
```

#### Issue 1.2: Tag Taxonomy Edge Cases

**Problem**: Tag classification has gaps for unknown sensor names.

```python
def _classify_tag(col_name: str, cfg: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None) -> str:
    # Returns "operating", "condition", or "unknown"
    # Unknown tags included if strict_operating_only=False (default)
```

**Impact**: Unknown tags may pollute regime basis or be incorrectly excluded.

**Recommendation**:
- Add equipment-specific tag classification config
- Log all "unknown" tags for manual review
- Default to **exclude** unknown tags (strict mode ON)

#### Issue 1.3: Confidence Threshold Not Enforced

**Problem**: Low-confidence assignments are flagged but still used.

```python
# predict_regime_with_confidence returns (labels, confidence, is_novel)
# But labels are ALWAYS assigned, even if confidence < 0.1
```

**Impact**: Regime labels appear certain even when model is uncertain.

**Recommendation**:
```python
# Add UNKNOWN regime (-1) for low confidence
if confidence < min_confidence_threshold:
    label = UNKNOWN_REGIME_LABEL  # -1
```

---

## 2. Are Regimes Stable?

### Current Stability Mechanisms

1. **Label Smoothing** (`smooth_labels`)
   - Median filter to remove single-sample noise
   - Multiple passes (default: 1)

2. **Transition Smoothing** (`smooth_transitions`)
   - Enforces minimum dwell time (seconds or samples)
   - Collapses short segments to adjacent regime

3. **Label Alignment** (`align_regime_labels`)
   - Maps new cluster IDs to previous IDs via Hungarian algorithm
   - Preserves regime identity across refits

### Issues Identified

#### Issue 2.1: Rare Regime Fragmentation

**Problem**: HDBSCAN subsampling (v11.1.7) can fragment rare regimes.

```python
# v11.1.7: Subsample to 8000 samples for performance
if n_samples > max_fit_samples:
    # RANDOM subsampling - breaks temporal contiguity
    subsample_indices = rng.choice(n_samples, size=max_fit_samples, replace=False)
```

**Impact**:
- Startup events (~500 samples) scattered across subsample
- HDBSCAN sees isolated points instead of contiguous cluster
- **Result**: Startup labeled as NOISE (-1) or absorbed into dominant regime

**Evidence**: See `docs/REGIME_DETECTION_FIX_v11_3_0.md` line 162-177 for min_cluster_size issues.

**Recommendation**:
```python
# v11.3.1 FIX: TIME-STRATIFIED subsampling (ALREADY IMPLEMENTED)
# Divide into time windows, sample proportionally from each
# Preserves temporal structure for transient regimes
# ✅ This fix is already in place at line 1104-1151
```

**Status**: ✅ FIXED in v11.3.1

#### Issue 2.2: Min Cluster Size Absolute vs Percentage

**Problem**: Min cluster size can suppress rare regimes if set as percentage.

```python
# v11.3.1: Uses ABSOLUTE threshold (default: 30-50 samples)
min_cluster_size = int(hdb_cfg.get("min_cluster_size_absolute", 30))
```

**Status**: ✅ FIXED in v11.3.1 (uses absolute, not percentage)

#### Issue 2.3: Label Alignment Failures

**Problem**: Alignment skipped on feature dimension mismatch, causes regime ID permutation.

```python
if new_centers.shape[1] != prev_centers.shape[1]:
    Console.warn("Feature dimension mismatch...")
    return new_model  # Returns UNALIGNED - regime IDs will permute!
```

**Impact**:
- Regime A in batch 1 becomes Regime C in batch 2 (same operating state, different ID)
- Historical comparisons break
- Dashboards show false "regime transitions"

**Recommendation**:
```python
# OPTION 1: Fail fast - raise error instead of silent skip
if new_centers.shape[1] != prev_centers.shape[1]:
    raise ValueError(
        f"Feature basis changed: {prev_centers.shape[1]} -> {new_centers.shape[1]}. "
        "Cannot align regimes. Retrain from scratch."
    )

# OPTION 2: Project to common subspace (if dims differ slightly)
# Use PCA to reduce both to min(dim1, dim2) before alignment
```

#### Issue 2.4: Smoothing Order Dependency

**Problem**: Label smoothing MUST happen before transition smoothing, but this isn't validated.

```python
# Current code (acm_main.py ~3030):
train_labels = smooth_labels(train_labels, passes=passes)
score_labels = smooth_labels(score_labels, passes=passes)
train_labels = smooth_transitions(train_labels, ...)  # CORRECT ORDER
score_labels = smooth_transitions(score_labels, ...)

# But calling order is NOT enforced - future refactors could break this
```

**Recommendation**:
- Add assertion in `smooth_transitions` to detect pre-smoothed labels
- Or combine into single `smooth_and_enforce_dwell()` function

---

## 3. Are Regimes Labeled Predictably?

### Current Prediction Path

1. **Model Caching** (`load_regime_model`)
   - Loads from `models/regime_model.joblib` + `regime_model.json`
   - Checks version compatibility (semantic versioning)

2. **Cache Invalidation** (`fit_regime_model`)
   - **v11.1.1 FIX**: Only checks feature columns, NOT data hash
   - Prevents constant refits from changing train_hash

3. **Prediction** (`predict_regime`)
   - Nearest center assignment
   - **v11.1.6 FIX**: Applies label_map_ for stable IDs

### Issues Identified

#### Issue 3.1: Model Refit Triggers

**Problem**: Model refits when feature columns change, but not when:
- Data distribution shifts (concept drift)
- New operating modes appear
- Sensor calibration changes

**Impact**: Outdated regimes persist until manual intervention.

**Recommendation**:
```python
# Add regime quality monitoring in production
# Trigger refit if:
# 1. Novel point ratio > 10% (new operating modes)
# 2. Confidence drops below 70% (distribution drift)
# 3. Silhouette score degrades > 20% from baseline
```

#### Issue 3.2: Feature Basis Signature

**Problem**: Basis signature (v11.1.6) uses scaler mean/var, but these change with new data.

```python
basis_signature = _compute_basis_signature(
    feature_columns,
    scaler_mean,  # Changes with new data!
    scaler_var,   # Changes with new data!
    n_pca
)
```

**Impact**: Cache invalidated unnecessarily when data distribution shifts slightly.

**Recommendation**:
```python
# Use SCHEMA signature only (columns + PCA count)
# Ignore scaler params (they SHOULD change with new data)
basis_signature = hashlib.md5(
    (",".join(sorted(feature_columns)) + f"|{n_pca}").encode()
).hexdigest()
```

## 4. Specific Recommendations

### Priority 1: Critical (Fix Immediately)

**R1.1: Remove Health-State Variables from Regime Clustering**

**File**: `core/regimes.py` lines 257-334

**Change**:
```python
# BEFORE (v11.3.0):
def build_feature_basis(...):
    basis = concat([pca_features, raw_operating_tags])
    basis_with_health = _add_health_state_features(basis, detector_scores)  # ❌ WRONG
    return basis_with_health

# AFTER:
def build_feature_basis(...):
    basis = concat([pca_features, raw_operating_tags])
    # Health tracked separately, not in regime clustering
    return basis
```

**Rationale**: Regimes should be **stable operating states**, not health-dependent clusters.

---

**R1.2: Enforce Minimum Confidence Threshold**

**File**: `core/regimes.py` line 3000-3020 (in `label()` function)

**Change**:
```python
# Add config parameter
min_confidence = _cfg_get(cfg, "regimes.min_confidence_threshold", 0.3)

# Enforce threshold
if score_confidence[i] < min_confidence:
    score_labels[i] = UNKNOWN_REGIME_LABEL  # -1
```

**Rationale**: Low-confidence assignments mask model uncertainty.

---

**R1.3: Fail Fast on Alignment Dimension Mismatch**

**File**: `core/regimes.py` line 2845-2883 (`align_regime_labels`)

**Change**:
```python
if new_centers.shape[1] != prev_centers.shape[1]:
    raise ValueError(
        f"Cannot align regimes: feature dimension changed "
        f"({prev_centers.shape[1]} -> {new_centers.shape[1]}). "
        "Regime model must be retrained from scratch."
    )
```

**Rationale**: Silent fallback causes unpredictable regime ID permutations.

---

### Priority 2: High (Fix Before Production)

**R2.1: Add Regime Quality Monitoring**

**File**: NEW - `core/regime_quality_monitor.py`

**Functionality**:
- Track silhouette score, confidence, novel ratio per batch
- Alert when quality degrades > 20% from baseline
- Trigger automatic refit when quality fails

---

**R2.2: Separate Health State Tracking**

**File**: `core/health_tracker.py` (MODIFY)

**Change**:
```python
# Track health PER REGIME, not globally
health_by_regime = {
    regime_id: {
        'current_health': 85.0,
        'trend': 'degrading',
        'quartile': 2
    }
}
```

**Rationale**: Allows regime-specific health thresholds and forecasts.

---

**R2.3: Improve Basis Signature Stability**

**File**: `core/regimes.py` line 686-708

**Change**:
```python
def _compute_basis_signature(feature_columns: List[str], n_pca: int) -> str:
    # SCHEMA-ONLY signature (ignore scaler params)
    sig_str = "cols:" + ",".join(sorted(feature_columns)) + f"|n_pca:{n_pca}"
    return hashlib.md5(sig_str.encode()).hexdigest()[:16]
```

---

### Priority 3: Medium (Technical Debt)

**R3.1: Consolidate Smoothing Functions**

**File**: `core/regimes.py`

**Change**:
```python
def smooth_and_enforce_dwell(
    labels: np.ndarray,
    timestamps: Optional[pd.Index] = None,
    smoothing_passes: int = 1,
    min_dwell_samples: int = 0,
    min_dwell_seconds: Optional[float] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    # Combined function to ensure correct order
    labels = smooth_labels(labels, passes=smoothing_passes)
    labels = smooth_transitions(labels, timestamps, min_dwell_samples, min_dwell_seconds)
    return labels
```

---

**R3.2: Add Integration Tests**

**File**: NEW - `tests/test_regime_stability.py`

**Tests**:
- Verify regimes stable across batches with same data
- Verify smoothing doesn't create new regime IDs
- Verify alignment preserves regime semantics
- Verify rare regimes detected (not lost to noise)

---

## 5. Testing Strategy

### Test Case 1: Regime Stability Across Batches

**Setup**:
- Run ACM on same equipment data twice
- Compare regime labels across runs

**Expected**:
- Same samples get same regime IDs (±smoothing variance)
- Regime centers remain within 5% Euclidean distance

**Current Status**: ❌ FAILS due to health-state coupling

---

### Test Case 2: Rare Regime Detection

**Setup**:
- Synthetic data with 1000 samples steady-state, 50 samples startup
- Run HDBSCAN clustering

**Expected**:
- Startup forms distinct cluster (not labeled noise)
- Min 2 regimes detected

**Current Status**: ✅ PASSES with v11.3.1 time-stratified subsampling

---

### Test Case 3: Label Alignment Consistency

**Setup**:
- Fit model on batch 1, get regime centers
- Fit model on batch 2, align to batch 1
- Check if high-load regime in batch 1 == high-load regime in batch 2

**Expected**:
- Regime IDs preserved for same operating conditions
- Alignment quality > 90% (by Euclidean distance)

**Current Status**: ⚠️ PARTIAL - works if feature dims match, fails otherwise

---

## 6. Diagnostic Tooling

A new diagnostic module has been created: `core/regime_diagnostics.py`

**Usage**:
```python
from core.regime_diagnostics import RegimeDiagnostics

diagnostics = RegimeDiagnostics(
    regime_model=model,
    regime_labels=labels,
    basis_df=basis_df,
    regime_confidence=confidence,
    regime_is_novel=is_novel
)

# Generate report
report = diagnostics.generate_report()
print(f"Quality Score: {report['quality_score']:.1f}/100")
print(f"Issues Found: {len(report['quality_issues'])}")

# Create plots
diagnostics.plot_stability_analysis(output_path="regime_diagnostics.png")
```

**Metrics Provided**:
- Regime count, transitions, dwell times
- Fragmentation score, label entropy
- Confidence distribution, novelty ratio
- Transition matrix, rare regime detection
- Overall quality score (0-100)
